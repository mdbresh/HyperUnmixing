# HyperUnmixing
The goal of this project is to perform unmixing of hyperspectral photo-induced force microscopy images of composite or mixed polymer films with distinct chemical signatures. The major inspiration for this is [Kong *et al.*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b01003)

We plan to explore the following techniques to apply the unmixing algorithm to other polymer datasets:
  - Convultional Neural Networks
    |**Pros** |**Cons**  |
    |---|:---:|
    |Spatially correlated | Complex/new |
    |Other applications explored | Scary! |
  - Non-negative Matrix Factorization*

  *There are many varieties of NMF including, but not limited to:*
      - Graph regularized NMF
      - Constrained NMF
      - Minimum volume constrained NMF*
